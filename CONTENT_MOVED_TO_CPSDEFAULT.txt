The content and the use of this product was only a skin and an extension profile
to register it.

This skin and profile settings for registering the skin has been moved to the
CPSDefault product.

The CPSTinyMCE product, in itself, is thus discontinued while the TinyMCE
integration in CPS is now done in the CPSDefault product.
